As a part of my personal interest in triathlon, I developed a tailored bottle mounting solution for my bike in CAD. I had it CNC milled in aluminum and it turned out that many others were interested in the solution. More about the devlopment of this can be found on [this page](../projects/bta_system_and_reach_extender/bta_system_and_reach_extender.md).

This led me to start my own company, named PrecisionWorks, which allows me to reach people interested in my projects in a whole different way. Furthermore, it teaches me a valuable lesson on DFM and the costs/considerations involved with the development of a simple product.
