Following my major interest in antennas and RF, I founded my business, RF by Boesen, in the end of 2024.
Afterwards I changed the name of the business to PrecisionWorks aiming to target a wider variety of engineering products and -solutions. <br>
Currently, this involves CNC machined aluminum adapters and -mounts for triathlon/TT bikes, but I am also very capable of doing passive RF design such as antennas and matching circuits.
This is done using a variety of simulation software to achieve the desired performance.
