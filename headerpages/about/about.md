![Profile picture](assets/profile_picture.png)

My name is Victor Boesen, and I am a masters student in wireless engineering at the Technical University of Denmark, expected to graduate in 2027.

For a long time, I have had a major interest in software defined radio, SDR, which in the last couple of years has evolved into a large compassion for RF design.
I feel privileged to be able to pursue my interests through my studies and at my job at [INVISIO](https://invisio.com/), where I play a crucial role in the design and testing of our wireless products.
